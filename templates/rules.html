                <li>Real-life events, including suicide roleplay, terrorism threats, pandemics, and mental illnesses, are strictly prohibited within the city.

We kindly request that you refrain from incorporating or depicting such sensitive topics in your roleplay.</li>
                <li>Roleplay should continue unless all parties involved in the scene or situation agree to pause or stop it. It is important to respect the consent and comfort of all participants. If there is a disagreement or discomfort during roleplay, it is essential to communicate openly and reach a consensus among all involved parties.</li>
                <li>It is strictly prohibited to use explicit or offensive names on any Vibe City platforms.</li>
                <li>We have a zero-tolerance policy towards racism, trolling, discrimination, homophobia, and sexism within our community.</li>
                <li>Treat each other with respect, everyone is equal.</li>

        <!-- Account and Donations -->
        <div id="account-donations" class="rule-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 neon-text-cyan">Account and Donations</h2>
            
            <h3>Account</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>You are solely responsible for all activities and actions that take place on your account. It is important to maintain the security of your account and ensure that you use it in accordance with the community guidelines and applicable rules. Any unauthorized use or misuse of your account may have consequences.</li>
                <li>The buying or selling of accounts and/or valuables from other users, except through official channels facilitated by the server owner, is strictly prohibited. Engaging in such transactions can lead to various risks, including scams, permanent character death, or bans. It is important to note that the community cannot be held accountable for any negative outcomes resulting from such unauthorized transactions. We strongly advise against engaging in these activities and encourage users to follow the official guidelines provided by the server owner for account-related transactions.</li>
                <li>If you lose access to your Discord account, please note that we are unable to transfer the Allowlist status to another Discord account. It is crucial to ensure the security and retention of your own Discord account to maintain your Allowlist status. We recommend taking necessary precautions to protect your account, such as enabling two-factor authentication and keeping your login credentials secure. In the event of an account loss, it will be necessary to reapply for Allowlist status with your new Discord account.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Donations</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>We understand that mistakes or unforeseen circumstances can occur, and we strive to accommodate our community members. Therefore, we offer a 24-hour window for refund requests on donations and purchases. If you believe there has been an error or if you find yourself in a unique situation, please reach out to Flawws, the owner, within 24 hours of the transaction. They will carefully consider your request and provide assistance accordingly. Your satisfaction and overall experience within our community are important to us.</li>
                <li>When making purchases or donations, the perks and benefits associated with them are tied to your specific account. During the process, you will be asked to specify the character to which the donation perks should be allocated. It is important to note that once the perks are granted to a character, you cannot change your selection in the future or transfer them to another character or account. Please make sure to carefully consider your choice before finalizing the allocation.</li>
                <li>In the event that a buyer is banned for violating the server rules, it is important to note that any purchases made by the buyer will not be refunded.</li>
                <li>In the case of a chargeback, it is important to note that any associated bans resulting from violating server rules cannot be appealed. Chargebacks refer to the reversal of a payment, and engaging in such actions can have serious consequences, including the forfeiture of the ability to appeal bans. We strongly advise against initiating chargebacks and encourage all community members to resolve any concerns or issues through proper channels, such as contacting server administrators or support. It is crucial to maintain open communication and address any concerns in a responsible and respectful manner.</li>
                <li>The selling of any items obtained through purchases is strictly prohibited within our community. We emphasize that purchased items are intended for personal use and enjoyment, and their sale to other members or third parties is not permitted.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Character</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Members serving as Police, Department of Corrections (DOC), Department of Justice (DOJ) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are strictly prohibited from engaging in any form of moderate or serious corruption. This includes actions such as giving away or selling equipment for personal gain. These roles are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and ethical conduct.</li>
                <li>It is essential to maintain a clear separation between your characters. Each character should exist independently, without any knowledge of the others' personal information, such as their weed location, relationships with friends or enemies, or any other details. It is crucial to avoid creating connections or relationships between characters that extend beyond the established roleplay context. By respecting this separation, you contribute to a more immersive and authentic roleplaying experience for all community members.</li>
                <li>Character names must adhere to a serious and appropriate tone. The use of meme names is not allowed and may result in disciplinary action or a name change without prior notice.</li>
                <li>Having multiple characters affiliated with the same circle or gang is not permitted within our community. It is important to maintain a clear separation between your characters' affiliations and roleplay experiences. Each character should have their own unique identity, connections, and associations. This rule ensures a more diverse and authentic roleplaying environment where interactions and conflicts remain distinct and separate.</li>
                <li>If a player has a camera on their character, they can use recordings as legal evidence, otherwise, they cannot.</li>
                <li>The inclusion of characters such as Serial Killers, Robots, Paranormal Characters, and other unique concepts requires prior approval from the staff team.</li>
                <li>To ensure an active and dynamic environment, we reserve the right to remove properties, including vehicles and houses, if a player has been inactive on the server for approximately 90 days. The purpose of this policy is to prevent properties from being tied up indefinitely by inactive players, allowing others to utilize them. If a player logs in sporadically, approximately once a week, with the intention of bypassing the inactivity period, it will not be considered as fulfilling the requirement, and the removal process will proceed as planned.</li>
                <li>Indicating that you have no pulse three or more times will result in the permanent death of your character.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <!-- Cheating and Exploiting -->
        <div id="cheating-exploiting" class="rule-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 neon-text-cyan">Cheating and Exploiting</h2>
            
            <h3>Game Modifications, Cheating & Macros</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>The use of game modifications and enhancements that provide players with unfair advantages, such as increased speed, no night visual packs, gumballs, health regeneration, teleportation, and other similar modifications, is strictly prohibited within our community. We prioritize fair gameplay and maintaining a level playing field for all members. Any player found cheating by using such modifications will face permanent banning without prior warning. We take cheating seriously to ensure an enjoyable and equitable gaming experience for all.</li>
                <li>Players are allowed to use visual enhancements or other game modifications that do not provide them with an unfair advantage or constitute cheating. These modifications should not give any player an unfair edge over others or disrupt the balance of gameplay. Additionally, binding keys to server commands or text messages for faster and more convenient access is permitted as long as it does not grant an unfair advantage.</li>
                <li>Macroing, which refers to the use of third-party software or hardware enhancements to automate actions, is strictly prohibited within our community. Engaging in macroing activities with the intent to gain a financial benefit or bypass AFK scripts is considered a bannable offense. Any property and experience obtained through macroing will be revoked. We maintain a fair and balanced gaming environment, and the use of macros undermines the integrity of the gameplay experience.</li>
                <li>Using no shadows is considered an unfair advantage so you must have shadows enabled.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Exploiting Bugs</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Exploiting client or server bugs is strictly prohibited within our community. Engaging in such activities, including the abuse of exploits, will result in a ban from the server. Additionally, any benefits or items gained from exploiting will be promptly removed.</li>
                <li>Camping animal and vehicle spawns, where players repeatedly wait in a known spot for the specific purpose of exploiting their appearance, is considered a form of exploitation within our community. We encourage a more natural and immersive gameplay experience where encounters occur organically. Engaging in repetitive behavior solely for the purpose of exploiting spawns disrupts the intended balance and fairness of the game. We kindly request that players refrain from such practices and allow the game to unfold naturally, fostering a more dynamic and authentic environment for everyone.</li>
                <li>Circumventing the emote cooldown by using the F8 menu or any other method is not allowed.</li>
                <li>All bugs must be reported on our Discord.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Communication Procedures</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Refusal to communicate with other players in English will result in a ban.</li>
                <li>Players are permitted to communicate with each other in another language, as long as the language being used does not violate any other rules, remains respectful, and all parties involved are comfortable with its use.</li>
                <li>Advertising other GTA V communities or engaging in cyber threats is strictly forbidden on all servers and channels within our community.</li>
                <li>It is important to refrain from spamming identical or meaningless messages multiple times, including the use of the /me command.</li>
                <li>In-character offensive language and threats are permitted within the boundaries of roleplay.</li>
                <li>Out-of-character offensive language, threats, or racism are strictly prohibited within our community.</li>
                <li>Excessively screaming swear words at individuals or directed towards a person is not tolerated within our community.</li>
                <li>If a staff member determines that a player is abusing the in-character exception for offensive language, they have the authority to request that the player stops offending another player's character.</li>
                <li>Players who are utilizing low-quality microphones or voice changers that negatively impact the overall voice quality will be addressed through a ticket system.</li>
                <li>Engaging in combative behavior towards staff or causing unnecessary issues can be grounds for removal from the community.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>OOC Terminology</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Out-of-character (OOC) discussions and conversations are encouraged to take place in Discord channels and are prohibited while in-game.</li>
                <li>The use of immersion-breaking words is strictly prohibited within our community.</li>
                <li>Under no circumstances are you permitted to mention or refer to other "cities" or "counties" within our community.</li>
                <li>Referring to other characters, whether they are your own or not, as "cousins", "alter egos", or similar terms is strictly prohibited.</li>
                <li>Using phrases like "the government" or "look to the skies" to refer to staff members is strictly prohibited.</li>
                <li>Engaging in discussions or using terminology related to spiritual and in your head matters is not allowed.</li>
                <li>To maintain the flow of roleplay, it is important to adapt and continue with the storyline despite encountering bugs or technical issues.</li>
                <li>Using words such as "weird" or "strange" to target or describe someone's roleplay in a derogatory manner is not allowed.</li>
                <li>Hinting at, or telling cops they must be bored for playing the role of their character is considered OOC terminology.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Report</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>We encourage players to utilize the Discord ticketing system to report any incidents involving other players.</li>
                <li>While using the /report command can be helpful for addressing immediate in-game issues, it is not a replacement for the ticketing system.</li>
                <li>When submitting a report, it is crucial to provide all necessary information and evidence related to the incident.</li>
                <li>We strive to process reports in a timely manner and aim to provide a resolution within 48 hours.</li>
                <li>If a player believes that a staff member is abusing their powers, they have the option to submit a player report using the Discord Ticket system.</li>
                <li>For effective communication and prompt resolution of issues, we kindly request that players refrain from personally messaging staff members regarding community-related concerns.</li>
                <li>Staff members have the authority to request players to pause or halt their actions in a roleplay situation if server rules have been violated or are currently being broken.</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- Crime and Gangs -->
        <div id="crime-gangs" class="rule-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 neon-text-cyan">Crime and Gangs</h2>
            
            <h3>Gangs</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Gangs within our community are not solely focused on engaging in constant conflicts and violence.</li>
                <li>The expectation within our community is that players should initiate roleplay and use verbal communication before resorting to shooting or engaging in combat.</li>
                <li>All the necessary information about gangs and the application process can be found in the comprehensive Gang Handbook.</li>
                <li>You cannot sit idle at delivery, start, etc... spots when taxing.</li>
                <li>When attempting to identify or apprehend individuals involved in the job that you are taxing, it is expected that you put in a considerate amount of effort and provide a high-quality roleplay experience.</li>
                <li>At any time, staff can revoke taxing for a specific job if the overall reward made from taxing an absurd amount.</li>
                <li>You may not use gang specific clothing, flags, or liveries that you would not realistically be able to acquire unless they have been obtained through roleplay.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Criminal Activities</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">

            <h3>General</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Cop baiting, intentionally provoking or luring police officers into scenarios without proper roleplay behind it, is considered a form of low-quality roleplay.</li>

                <li>Hospital camping, which refers to intentionally waiting or lingering near a hospital to taunt or provoke players who have recently lost a fight, is not permitted.</li>
                <li>Scenes in Vibe City should be utilized to enhance roleplay by providing context and atmosphere.</li>
                <li>During interactions with police officers, it is essential for criminals to provide a valid and proper reasoning during initiation before resorting to shooting.</li>
                <li>Randomly blowing up vehicles without proper initiation is strictly prohibited within Vibe City.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Fail/Low Quality Roleplay</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>FailRP, also known as Low Quality RP, refers to actions that are unrealistic or detrimental to the roleplay experience of other players.</li>

            <h3>Value of Life</h3>
            <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2">
                <li>Value of Life: Players must prioritize their character's life and act as if they have only one life.</li>
                <li>If you find yourself in a situation where you are at a clear disadvantage, it is expected that you comply with the demands of the other party.</li>
                <li>In situations where you are outnumbered by a significant margin, it is generally expected that you comply with the group's demands.</li>
                <li>A bad example of an attempt to escape would be if you are being held hostage in front of a bank and, despite the person holding a firearm ready to use, you suddenly decide to run away without any reasonable chance of success.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Economy Rules</h3>

                <li>Asset limitations enforced by the LSRS application must never be bypassed and selling outside of the script in place is considered exploiting.</li>
                <li>Example: Travis purchased an import for $360k. He is now selling it to Taylor at an agreed price of $1,000,000. Taylor sends Travis a $640,000 direct transfer and then accepts the sale through the app for the remaining amount that the script allows for. In doing so, the buyer has lower asset fees despite buying the car for a higher amount.</li>
            </ol>
